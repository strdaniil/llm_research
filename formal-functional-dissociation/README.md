# formal-functional-dissociation
This repo hosts the code for the paper *Are formal and functional language mechanisms dissociated in pre-trained language models?*. To replicate the results, just:
1. Install the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file. This may require that you separately install the `eap` library from the `EAP-IG` folder.
2. Run the scripts in `scripts/`. 
3. Create the figures using the outputs in `results/`, by running the scripts located there.

More info coming soon!
